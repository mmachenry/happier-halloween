A Minecraft resource pack which eliminates pumpkin blur.

The Problem
---
Did you know that you can wear a pumpkin on your head in Minecraft? Well you
can. Why would you want to? Firstly, to look stylish, but more importantly,
it's pretty helpful for surviving The End. Endermen are a neutral mob in
Minecraft and will leave you been unless you act aggressively toward them. The
difference between Enderman and all other neutral mobs, however, is that they
consider eye contact to be an act of aggression, and if you hover your mouse
cursor over them, they will attack you.

The End is another dimension of the Minecraft world and absolutely covered with
Endermen. It's sometimes difficult to traverse The End without accidentally
provoking one of them on occasion. The solution is to wear a pumpking on your
head. This fools them. The downside is that it really obscurs your vision
pretty badly, making it hard to see where you're going. In a world where one
wrong step can me falling into the abyss, this is a problem.

The Solution
---
This resource pack is extremely simple. It replaces the overlay PNG for pumpkin
blur with one that doesn't block out your visible range.
